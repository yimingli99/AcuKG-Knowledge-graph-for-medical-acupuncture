# **AcuKG: Acupuncture Knowledge Graph**

## **Overview**
AcuKG is a structured and scalable acupuncture knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources to enhance the accessibility, discoverability, and application of acupuncture knowledge. By leveraging structured domain knowledge, AcuKG supports clinical decision-making, evidence-based acupuncture research, and the integration of acupuncture with modern digital healthcare tools.

## **Features**
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Integration**: AcuKG consolidates information from authoritative sources, including acupuncture textbooks, official websites, clinical trials, and biomedical literature.
- **Standardized Representation**: Utilizes anatomical ontologies such as UBERON and SNOMED-CT for consistent classification of acupuncture points.
- **Enhanced Queryability**: Enables efficient retrieval of relationships between acupoints, anatomical structures, and therapeutic indications.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Facilitates personalized treatment recommendations based on structured knowledge.

## **Data Files**
AcuKG is built from multiple data sources, structured into CSV files:

| File Name            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `Action_target.csv`  | Mapping of acupoints to their therapeutic actions and target organs. |
| `Chinesename.csv`    | Traditional Chinese names for acupuncture points. |
| `Clinicaltrial.csv`  | Acupuncture-related clinical trial data for acupoints. |
| `direction_of.csv`   | Directional relationships between acupoints and anatomy. |
| `distance_of.csv`    | Distance-based relationships between acupuncture points and anatomy. |
| `Indication.csv`     | Indications for acupuncture treatment mapped to acupoints. |
| `located_near.csv`   | Spatial proximity relationships among acupoints and anatomy. |
| `near_acupoint.csv`  | Nearby acupuncture points in relation to each other. |
| `part_of.csv`        | Hierarchical relationships of acupoints within anatomical structures. |
| `pinyinname.csv`     | Pinyin transliterations of acupuncture point names. |
| `PubMed.csv`         | Conditions of acupoints to PubMed articles. |
